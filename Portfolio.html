		  <div class="contentTitle"><h1>Data visualization and Math Modelling(2015)</h1></div>
		  <div class="contentText">
		  <p>This project has yet to be fully started but within the next few months there should be major progress made. Essentially to supplement my Math Modelling course which
			expects students to visualize their data in Excel, I will instead of be transferring one or two of the projects to JavaScript using D3.js. I have chosen to do this for many reasons,
			the two most important being to learn JavaScript in a more traditional web application and also to test the waters on a topic I have been interested in for a few months now(Data visualization).
			This will be updated with more details as soon as possible.</p>

		  <div class="contentTitle"><h1>Android MediaPlayer(2015)</h1></div>
		  <div class="contentText">
          <p>As mentioned elsewhere on the site, android applications have been my recent interest and as such I want to work on a project that's at least medium scale. I have chosen to do this as a senior project in the coming
		  semester. The basic outline being an application that can play music files, create playlists, and has a professional feel to it. One of the key features that I am attempting to include is the connection to android wear
		  not only for app control(volume,track controls, etc) but also to allow the app to pick songs matching your heart rate. This is thanks to most, if not all, android watches having a heart beat sensor built in.
		  This will be updated with more details as soon as possible.</p>

		<div class="contentTitle"><h1>EpicLauncher(2015)</h1></div>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p>Although this seems like too small of an application to really call a project, it is the beginning work for something I plan to complete over the summer. Creating a custom android launcher was an idea that
		  I threw around last summer before I even began learning android development. I tried to tackle the project but due to my lack of knowledge in the subject matter, I quickly got lost and put it off. This was around
		  July 2014. When I finally began to learn android from the fundamentals, around November 2014, I stuck to mostly reading books on the subject matter. I still played around with the idea of making my own launcher, but 
		  did not have time to begin working on one. During Winter break between semesters I continued learning the fundamentals and quickly finished many of the reading materials I had selected. Looking for a small exercise,
		  I decided to create the foundation for a custom launcher. Currently, I have only spent about a days worth of work into this but it can grab and list all the applications on a device. Click the read more, to 
		  continue reading and see screenshots of the launcher or click the github link down below to see the source.</p>

        <div class="contentTitle"><h1>Js Graphics Engines(2014)</h1></div>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p>This was a project that I undertook on the last half of 2014. I wanted to work on something that not only involved technologies that I haven't used before, specifically JavaScript, but also to reinforce
		  a lot of mathematical concepts that I was weak in. So the idea of doing a web based graphics project was pretty easy to choose. Not only did it slowly introduce me to JavaScript syntax, but it also covers
		  Matrix operations and computer graphics(an area i've never touched before). All in all the 2D engine took me about 1.5months to get to its current state, working on it casually one or two days a week. The following 
		  3D engine took much longer, but also because the project had gotten shelved for a bit as midterms and finals were taking over my time. The code is up on my github for those who want to take a look. The JavaScript is
		  Object Oriented which is most likely my struggle as a Java developer switching to a new language. Most of the code, in my opinion, is Java code written in JavaScript syntax. Click read more to read about the
		  details of this project.</p>

        <div class="contentTitle"><h1>KanjiQuiz(2014)</h1></div>
        <div class="contentText">
		<p>KanjiQuiz was a small to medium sized application that I was going to complete for a friend who wanted to work on his knowledge of Kanji(one of the three japanese languages). A lot of the layout and design for the GUI
			were his choices, as I tried to work with him whenever possible to make sure the app was what he would want. Although the project never got far off the ground it was still one of favorite 
			ones to plan out and begin work on. Even though there is only 6-8 hours of actual work put into it, including planning/design as well as coding. The code once again is available on github, 
			it is a Java based app that uses the JavaFX libraries for GUI development.</p>

		<div class="contentTitle"><h1>WareHouse Inventory(2014)</h1></div>
		<div class="contentText">
		<p>Unlike all the other projects listed on this page, this one was part of a school assignment. I did have a partner that worked on this application as well, so I will mostly talk about my responsibilities.
			I will also point out that at the current time I do not have a copy of the source code but will attempt to find at least some version of it soon. The basic outline of the system was to be able to have an
			inventory database that can be updated and maintained by workers in a warehouse. So a key aspect of this assignment was to get familiar with relational databases. Which is what I had worked on for the
			few weeks I had to do this assignment. The technologies used were Java and MySQL.</p>
