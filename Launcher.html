          <p>This is a very small application, consisting of only 3 Java classes and 3 XML layouts. Although it is a good exercise to get familiar
			with using Adapters, in this case, I used the ArrayAdapter to create the views for the elements in the ListView that displays the applications.
			<br>
			The next step would be possibly just giving it a more finished look by making the show apps button anchored at the bottom of the screen and giving it
			an image rather than just a simple button. Then I would like to have it launch an app drawer that a user can traverse, instead of just a ListView. 
			<br>
			Although for now, I think this project will be shelved until at least May as I have other things I want to play around with in the coming months.
