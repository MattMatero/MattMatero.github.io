          <p>I am currently a last semester senior at Adelphi University expecting to graduate in May 2015. I have spent all four years of my education at Adelphi, acquiring both a bachelors of science in Computer Science 
		  as well as Mathematics. A quick listing of my personal favourite skills that I have obtained over the years would be: 
			<br>
			<br>
			<ul>
			<li>Java and OOP principles</li>
			<li>GUI Design and Development</li>
			<li>Web programming</li>
			<li>Android</li>
			<li>Mathematical Modelling</li>
			</ul>
		  </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>My recent interests have been very ironic as they are more a breath of life in old interests than completely new. When I first began familiarizing myself with any type of computer programming I of course began
		  with HTML. Which of course, is not a programming language but for a high school student who didn't know where to begin or if he was determined to even be a software developer it was a common place to start. I took
		  a web design course my junior year of high school, which I ended up mostly teaching as the teacher did not have much knowledge on the subject. I spent a few months learning standard HTML tags and then later moved on
		  to learning CSS. Since then I've done very minimal work with web design/development, making only a few webpages for classes that required them and learning a bit of JavaScript towards the middle of 2014, many years after
		  I originally was interested in it.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>I think much of the reason why I didn't continue my education towards full web developer at the time was because Smartphones were becoming more and more popular and this really made my head turn towards the mobile world.
		  I kept very up to date with the current flagship devices and followed android releases very close. I did this for most of my senior year of high school and freshmen year of college. This ultimately encouraged me to spend most
		  of my time programming/learning Java(which was a bonus since my intro course was also in the language). During my freshmen year I messed around with the Android SDK very little but didn't have quite a handle on designing
		  GUIs and full applications, so it did get put to a side burner for a while but every so often I did attempt to learn more and more. Ultimately it took until my senior year of college before I truly took the dive and began
		  reading many books on Android development, Android UI design, and general practices. 
		  </p>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>So both areas that I am currently interested in and what pulled me into computer science/programming at the beginning have come full circle for me. Although now I have more of a drive to learn them more in depth than 
		  before and I also have the means and knowledge to do so. Prior to messing with android and learning new web technologies, most of my programming experience is in the Java language which
		  I not only have used for multiple classes throughout my degree but also during my internship after my first year of college. That internship was also my first exposure to (MS)SQL, JSP, Apache, and BIRT(Business Intelligence Reporting Tool).
		  To continue my knowledge of Web development I plan to work with JavaScript and play around with charting libraries, specifically <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a>. Which will be used in a small project sometime during
		  the spring of 2015. Until then I plan to be working on a Ruby/MySQL web app for my senior project.
