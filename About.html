          <p>I am currently a last semester senior at Adelphi University expecting to graduate in May 2015. I have spent all four years of my education at Adelphi, acquiring both a bachelors of science in Computer Science 
		  as well as Mathematics. A quick listing of my personal favourite skills that I have obtained over the years would be: 
			<br>
			<br>
			<ul>
			<li>Java and OOP principles</li>
			<li>GUI Design and Development</li>
			<li>Javascript web programming</li>
			<li>Android</li>
			<li>Mathematical Modelling</li>
			</ul>
		  </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>I have just recently stepped into the world of android development but after spending 2 months reading books and tutorials I intend to increase my proficiency in this environment by creating my own application. I plan
			on having it completed by the end of spring. Mobile development has	been an interest of mine for many years but I never had the time to fully commit to learning it. 
			Now that the time is available I am hoping to learn as much as possible.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>Prior to that, most of my programming experience is in the Java language which I not only have used for multiple classes throughout my degree but also during my internship after my first year of college.
		  That internship was also my first exposure to (MS)SQL, JSP, Apache, and BIRT(Business Intelligence Reporting Tool).
		  </p>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>As well as Java and Android development I have also been spending some time over the past 6 months learning Javascript and implementing it within some projects. Most notably as of today I have both a small 2 Dimensional
		  and 3 Dimensional Graphics engine that runs entirely on the web through Javascript. For more information, you can check my portfolio.
		  To continue my knowledge of Javascript I also have played around with charting libraries, specifically <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a>. I plan on using this library in an upcoming project as well.
